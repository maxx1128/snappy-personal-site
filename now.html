  Work history and portfolios only tell someone so much. So here's some info about what I'm doing <strong>right now</strong>.

<h2>
  Working
</h2>

<p>
  I'm working at SeeClickFix, a civic tech app that lets citizens report municipal issues to local governments. I help develop and manage the front-end of the web apps. This includes managing our design system, bringing us in line with federal accessibility standards, and building out UIs for pages and components.
</p>

<p>
  My career goals now are to build my JavaScript and accessibility knowledge and skills. I'm researching and practicing both, and trying not to neglect larger topics to learn like coding best practices and patterns.
</p>

<h2>
  Writing
</h2>

<p>
  I'm writing many blog posts at any given time, most of which focus on explaining complex topics in simpler, weirder ways. Right now this includes explaining the big 23 design patterns in the form of retelling popular fairy tales. I don't have any long-term goals for my blogging. I do it because I enjoy it, it helps me build on and retain knowledge, and it helps others learn similar topics.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also writing a fiction novel as a personal passion project. I'm planning to release it chapter by chapter and will hopefully release the first few soon. I have a few other fiction ideas, many of which use frontend code and styling to pump them up a bit. But I'm taking it slow here and not getting ahead of myself.
</p>

<h2>
  Coding
</h2>

<p>
  Aside from my job at SeeClickFix, I'm usually working on a few code side projects. I don't focus a lot on side projects like this, since I prefer emphasizing the small wins each day instead of trying (and often failing) to force a big win. But I use them as a chance to flesh out new skills or experiment with new tools and ideas, such as learning more React and front-end architectures. These usually take the form of making small games, but I'm considering making side-projects that mix front-end code and short story fiction later on.
</p>

<h2>
  Reading
</h2>

<p>
  I'm currently working through JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani, to pick up on any additional best practices for JavaScript-focused applications. I'm also flipping through other books related to professional code architecture and best practices, like Clean Code. I'm knowledgeable of the frontend but not the larger systems and setups its a part up, and am trying to bridge that gap.
</p>

<p>
  I'm working through lots of programming and career articles on my list. Here are <a href="https://www.notion.so/maxantonucci/Waiting-Articles-4bb0d6d09ebb48829d46c032251a32f8" target="_blank">the articles I'm going to read</a>, and <a href="https://www.notion.so/maxantonucci/Take-Notes-On-cc620dad19e546c28642a44b5ff3faf8" target="_blank">here are the articles I'm going to take notes on</a>.
</p>

<p>
  For fun I'm currently reading "Wool" by Hugh Howey. When I need a break from that, I'm rereading "I Am America (And So Can You)" by the The Colbert Report. I always try to make time for fiction reading to feed my imagination while still giving it a break.
</p>

<h2>
  Living
</h2>

<p>
  I'm residing in a cozy apartment in New Haven, CT. I'm enjoying the pizza, making things at MakeHaven, and trying to visit all the bookstores. I enjoy where I live and don't have plans to move anytime soon. I'm grateful I'm lucky enough to be able to live alone and so close to where I work.
</p>

  Smuggling
</h2>

<p>
  I'm not telling if you're not asking.
