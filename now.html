<p>
  Work history and portfolios only tell someone so much. So here's some info about what I'm doing <strong>right now</strong>.
</p>

<h2>
  Working
</h2>

<p>
  I'm working at SeeClickFix, a civic tech app that lets citizens report municipal issues to local governments. I help develop and manage the front-end of the web apps. This includes managing our design system, bringing us in line with federal accessibility standards, and building out UIs for pages and components.
</p>

<h2>
  Writing
</h2>

<p>
  I'm writing many blog posts at any given time, most of which focus on explaining complex topics in simpler, weirder ways. Right now this includes explaining the big 23 design patterns in the form of retelling popular fairy tales. Anything I want to write that doesn't fit this stays in my personal blog, and even <em>more</em> off-topic writing goes into my Notes.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also writing a fiction novel as a personal passion project. I'm planning to release it chapter by chapter and will have the first few uploaded in its web format soon!
</p>

<h2>
  Coding
</h2>

<p>
  In addition to all my code work at SeeClickFix, I'm working on several code side projects.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Bringing my anime quote image generator away from CodePen and into <a href="https://github.com/maxx1128/anime-quote-maker" target="_blank">a stand-alone repository build on React and Parcel</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/maxx1128/eleventy-personal-site" target="_blank">Migrating my personal website from Jekyll and Webpack to Eleventy</a>, due to its faster, simpler, and more maintainable setup.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/maxx1128/react-pokedex" target="_blank">Building a fully functioning and styled Pokedex built on React, Parcel, Emotion</a>, and pulling data from the Pokemon API.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Reading
</h2>

<p>
  I'm currently working through JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani, to pick up on any additional best practices for JavaScript-focused applications.
</p>

<p>
  I'm working through lots of programming and career articles on my list. Here are <a href="https://www.notion.so/maxantonucci/Waiting-Articles-4bb0d6d09ebb48829d46c032251a32f8" target="_blank">the articles I'm going to read</a>, and <a href="https://www.notion.so/maxantonucci/Take-Notes-On-cc620dad19e546c28642a44b5ff3faf8" target="_blank">here are the articles I'm going to take notes on</a>.
</p>

<p>
  For fun I'm currently reading "Wool" by Hugh Howey. When I need a break from that, I'm reading "I Am America (And So Can You)" by The Colbert Report.
</p>

<h2>
  Living
</h2>

<p>
  I'm residing in a cozy apartment in New Haven, CT. I'm enjoying the pizza, making things at MakeHaven, and trying to visit all the bookstores.
</p>


<h2>
  Smuggling
</h2>

<p>
  I'm not telling if you're not asking.
