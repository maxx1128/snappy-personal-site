    This is a big board of things I've done, small and large, that I'm especially proud of. You'll see a mix of coding work, rewards, little hobbies, events, and who knows what else. When I take over New Haven through a targeted sonic wave attack, it'll be here.

    For my coding projects here, I can't promise the older ones use sexy new tools or have been well-maintained. But at the time, I swear they were pristine and perfect.
