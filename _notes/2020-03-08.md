Modern society does a lot to encourage lazy, consumptive mindsets. These include advertising, manipulative psychology, capitalist culture, and floods of social and video media to drown our minds in. It's not good for the population, but it's great for those in power. [As George Carlin said, a population of critical thinkers is against their interests](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1140273).

This is bad, but it gets trickier with how we sometimes need some lazy time. Times where we let our fatigued minds recover by mindlessly consuming things. Things like peanut butter pancakes, humorous "let's play" videos, or [visual novels mixing romance, horror, and folklore mysteries](https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/world-end-syndrome).

This is a shade of gray, but also a warning. Our occasional need for laziness makes the culture encouraging it more dangerous. Needing a little laziness makes it easy for others to convince people they need too much.

The best lies are mostly truth. Don't let that strand of truth push you into unhealthy territory.
