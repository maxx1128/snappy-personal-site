Need some inspiration porn? I recently updated my phone wallpapers with some anime wallpaper creations.

<ul class="flex mb-2 flex-col sm:flex-row items-center justify-around list-reset">
  <li class="sm:w-1/2 p-1 mb-0">
    <img class="block mx-auto sm:w-3/4 md:w-1/2" src="/assets/images/notes/phone-lock-screen.png" alt="Anime artwork with the quote 'hold yourself responsible for a higher standard than anybody expects of you. Never excuse yourself. Never pity yourself.'">
  </li>
  <li class="sm:w-1/2 p-1 mb-0">
    <img class="block mx-auto sm:w-3/4 md:w-1/2" src="/assets/images/notes/phone-wallpaper.png" alt="Anime artwork with the quote 'you can only make the choice if you remember it's there.'">
  </li>
</ul>

As an added bonus, people who see them will think I'm a naturally motivated, discipline person. As opposed to the truth: **I'm a typical lazy, distractable human using mental tricks to avoid those impulses.**
