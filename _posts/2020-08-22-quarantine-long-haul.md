### COVID Log,

#### Month 5, Day 2

So it's been roughly five months in self-isolation since the Coronavirus seriously starting hitting the United States, and I'm feeling more of the strain. I've been inside my apartment so long I'm half-convinced it's the world's longest and least deadly Saw movie trap. I'm convinced the neighbor's kids only play and scream outside to torture me as I work. I keep buying Switch games when they're on sale but never seem to play most of them. And either my sanity is finally starting to slip away or I'm seeing the squirrels outside using a clipboard to take notes when they usually record things with a hidden microphone.

It's no surprise that [an underfunded mental health system in the United States is helping to fuel a second pandemic of mental illness](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/04/mental-health-coronavirus/). Most people didn't know the scale of what was happening until we were in the thick of it, and there was no time to prepare. Back in March I thought we'd be on lockdown for a month a most. Now we're coming up on half a year and there's still no end in sight. Imagine thinking you're going to be waiting ten minutes at a car repair, and it winds up taking four hours. If you can't imagine that, remember the last time it happened and all the wonderful emotions it brought. Mix in a dose of threats to the physical health of you and all your loved ones, bake in the oven who the hell knows how long, then eat the result no matter how nauseas you get. This is the present day.

There's no substitute for professional help, and no one should let the stigmas around therapy keep them from it now. But in the event you can't get any for whatever reason, in this five months I've found ways to better manage the anxiety. They may not completely stop my descent to madness, but they'll at least slow it down.

At least that what the squirrels said to me through the morse code messages they tap out on the outside fences. But if you can't trust them, who can you trust?

### Let Yourself Be Un-Amazing

Of the many idiotic societal expectations, a frequent one is that you must be amazing to have any value. For the coronavirus, this translates to: "if you don't make yourself awesome while in quarantine, you have less value as a human." It's most often spouted by white people, especially white men, but I'm sure this is just a frequent coincidence.

Back in reality, most people are stranded in the same place and under extra layers of fear and stress from any number of factors. These aren't the best conditions for even the best people to flourish and master new skills or learn new tricks. For those who can, it's more a sign of priviledge than discipline or badass-ary.

You know what's more amazing to pull off right now? Staying physically and mentally healthy against what's probably the scariest point in history in many of our lifetimes. It's just not as sexy to social media followers or venture capitalists. But they're a lot less likely to keep us alive in the long-term.

So if I probably won't use this quarantine time to become a superhuman made of pure energy with fancy new kitchen appliances. Most likely, I'll be buying some more Switch games than usual and giving myself extra time each day to unwind with them. But I'll be surviving the pandemic without worsening it, and that's already pretty awesome on its own.

### Get Out of your Head

The longer I'm in my apartment, the more often it's a container for all my thoughts to pile up in. Its like filling up a water balloon, and the only way to keep it from popping is to stop the water and  let some out if you can. Otherwise the pressure builds, I lose focus and energy, stop taking care of myself, and the spy squirrels start yelling at me.

This makes me think of one of the first lessons in "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living." One of the best ways to escape worry is to leave no room for it in your mind. Someone can only seriously focus on one thing at a time, so we should put that focus towards something less worrying whenever we can. It can be books, games, side projects, assassination plots, or whatever else takes more than some casual thinking.

So I've been trying to focus on any project I can lose myself in. How productive it is isn't as important as how much attention and energy it takes. Playing video games isn't productive in many ways at all, but it's hard to think about pandemics while seeing how the Koopalings used to look compared to their sleek designs in Super Smash Bros.

Some healthier and cheaper ways to approach this could just be going for a walk with some music, any form of exercise, journaling or blogging about anything else on your mind, or dropping your thoughts into a Pensieve. The best one by far for me has been updating my website. Moving from one static site generator to another is just the right mix of monotony and careful planning. I don't know how much better it'll be, but in terms of sheer distraction it's already more than worth it.

The point isn't to do any of these things perfectly, or even well. It's to keep too many thoughts from clouding your mind and distracting your values and relationships. Busyness isn't always progress, but it's often better than stewing in a cauldron of boredom and anxiety.

Speaking of relationships...

### Get a Routine of Chatting with Others

The above two tips have helped me, but what's easily helped the most is a gaming group I meet with at least twice a week. We discuss life, watch movies, play games, show off cute pets, and spin elaborate stories behind randomized murders.

Staying in touch with people is obviously important, but I'd argue one of the most important elements is keeping it routine. Social needs don't go away, so knowing they can be consistently and reliably met goes a long way in easing our minds. It's also something to look forward to during the week that perks us up in tougher solo times.

This only gets bad if you're at the point where you're constantly checking your phone for messages or alerts. To the point where it disrupts anything else you should be doing, like working or taking a shower. That's when it goes from healthy relationships to unhealthy dependencies. Which is a line that's too easy to cross during a pandemic.
