Dear Baby Boomers who may be angry at Millennials for whatever reason,

This is a letter from me to you. Your generation has a lot of criticisms about mine, and mine about yours.  I'm going to attempt to write a post about different American generations without rehashing the usual bashings and insults thrown back and forth. Not because I don't also get a visceral enjoyment from that, or it makes me feel wittier and sharper than I really am.

It's because my basic thoughts on this can be distilled to one thing.

**The millennial generation isn't "special." Neither is yours.**

HOW TO EXPAND ON THIS?

## Cross-Generational Condescension is Just What We Do

Start with understanding how condescension to younger people is just something people do in society. I already have knee-jerk reactions to do the same about Gen Z people that I need to continuously remind myself to not indulge in. But just because something is typical and expected doesn't mean I can't address it in my own small way. Accepting it as expected doesn't mean accepting it as is - that's just defeatist.

## Changing Generational Values is Just What Happens

Changing values between generations is what generations do. Society and the world changes, and different generations find values that aid in their survival. Look for generational differences between boomers and the older generations?

If they want their values to survive, should've done the work so society can better maintain them. Not putting in a solid infrastructure or system that lets millennials feel confident enough in their future to settle down or aim for a secure, more predictable future is on them since they're the generation in power. Use the destroyed house metaphor?

One value that persists is the one of the American Dream, which is thrown back against any criticisms or observations about generational disparity. Nothing can't be dismissed with a "you're not trying hard enough, therefore it's your fault." Frustrating enough, next point will show the real damage this can cause.

## You Grew up an Objectively Easier System

you objectively had an easier time growing up. College payments, stable career paths, before a major financial crisis. Also more medical and other safety net support? Look up some info on all this, have articles to back it up.

* GI Bill - https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/postwarera/postwar-era/a/the-gi-bill
* Segregationist housing policies that helped them while locking in difficulties for us - https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/boomers-are-blame-aging-america/592336/
* Economic benefits of the industrial era while our generation gets the environmental drawbacks threatening the planet's (and the economy's) long-term viability.

* The housing market crash
* Exploding college costs and student debt
* Rising automation

All this is especially bad with the persistent value of "you're just not trying hard enough to reach the American Dream." Sometimes the issue is trying harder. But when you're in a game designed this poorly which leaves few real ways to win, the first step isn't hard work - it's fixing the system so hard work actually leads somewhere.

Can't just chalk your success up to "we tried harder." Maybe you did, maybe you didn't, I'm in no place to judge there. But you had a system where your hard work much more easily translated to long-term success. We don't have that.

## Wrapping Up

Lastly, don't act this way to a younger generation while claiming you just care about their welfare and wellbeing. If so, you'd be helping the younger generation solve these problems instead of victim-blaming and brushing them off as something for us to deal with.
