  An Exocortex is a theoretical augmentation to a person's brain. It's basically extra functions and memory you could add to a brain to make people smarter.

<p>
  They don't really exist yet, so this notebook is my exocortex in the meantime. I keep it full of notes for reference and sharing. Most are related to web development but could honestly be about anything - nonfiction, fiction, general life skills and topics, and whatever else I want remember without relying on my unreliable brain.

  You can all the categories I keep my ExoCortex documents in below. <a class="hidden" id="random-exocortex-link">Or you can surprise yourself with a completely random one.</a>

{% assign category_pages = site.exocortex | where_exp:"item", "item.category_page == true" %}

{% include exocortexCards.html
  collection = category_pages
